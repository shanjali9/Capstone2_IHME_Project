    "Dataset: IHME: USA Health Care Spending by Payer 1996-2016\n",
    "Dataset Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adarshsng/usa-health-care-spending-19962016?select=IHME_DEX_1996_2016.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Defining Question\n",
    "The primary question guiding this analysis is: â€œHow does the cost of healthcare vary across different types of care?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hypothesis\n",
    "Healthcare spending patterns in the USA vary significantly across different types of care, payer categories, demographic factors such as gender and age group, and have shown an overall increasing trend from 1996 to 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data Collection Summary\n",
    "The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the Disease Expenditure Project (DEX) at IHME. It covers US spending on healthcare categorized by three types of payers (public insurance, private insurance, out-of-pocket payments) across various dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Period: 1996 to 2016\n",
    "\n",
    "Payers: Public insurance (including Medicare, Medicaid, and other government programs), private insurance, out-of-pocket payments\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensions: Health condition, age group, sex, type of care (ambulatory care, inpatient care, nursing care facility stay, emergency department care, dental care, prescribed pharmaceutical care, government administration and net cost of insurance programs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimates are derived from government budgets, insurance claims, facility records, household surveys, and official US records.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data Cleaning Summary\n",
    "During the initial data exploration and cleaning process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Missing Values: Rows with missing values were removed to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling NaNs: NaN values in numeric columns were replaced with 0 where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing Duplicates: Duplicate rows were identified and removed to maintain dataset consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Column Renaming: Column names were standardized for clarity and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary Statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Years Covered: The dataset spans from 1996 to 2016, providing insights into healthcare spending trends over two decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Care: Includes ambulatory care, inpatient care, nursing care facility stay, emergency department care, dental care, prescribed pharmaceutical care, and government administration and net cost of insurance programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Payers: Segmented into public insurance, private insurance, and out-of-pocket payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Health Categories: Aggregated estimates across 14 health categories derived from 154 conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median Costs by Type of Care:\n",
    "Ambulatory Care: The median cost is $1041.47 per individual treated annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inpatient Care: The median cost is $902.38 per individual treated annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prescribed Pharmaceutical Care: The median cost is $351.54 per individual treated annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emergency Department Care: The median cost is $136.91 per individual treated annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nursing Care Facility Stay: Specific median cost data was not available in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Government Administration and Net Cost of Insurance Programs: The median cost is $314.97 per individual treated annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Data Visualization and Insights\n",
    "Visual representations such as scatterplots, histograms, and bar charts were utilized to analyze and interpret the varying costs associated with different types of care across insurance categories. Key insights include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Public Insurance: Higher costs observed for conditions such as Musculoskeletal, Cardiovascualr and Communicable diseases. Moderate costs were observed for Mental/ Behavioural disorders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private Insurance: Significant costs associated with Musculoskeletal, Communicable and Endocrinology compared to other types. Lowest observed for cirrhosis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Out-of-Pocket Costs: Similar trends with higher costs for non communicable, neurological, musculoskeletal. Moderate costs were observed for Well care.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Additional Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Gender Impact:\n",
    "Women tend to incur higher healthcare costs compared to men across insurance categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age Group Analysis:\n",
    "Healthcare costs peak in the 45-50 age group and are lowest in the 10-15 age group. The highest costs amount up to approximately $180,000 per individual treated annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type of Care Impact:\n",
    "Ambulatory and inpatient care incur the highest costs per individual treated annually, while emergency department care has the lowest expenditures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "In conclusion, this analysis highlights significant variability in healthcare costs across different types of care, insurance categories, gender, and age groups over the years 1996 to 2016. The findings corroborate the hypothesis of increasing healthcare spending in the USA, underscoring the importance of data-driven insights for healthcare policy-making and resource allocation strategies."
